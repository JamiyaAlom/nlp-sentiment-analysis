review
I absolutely loved this movie! It was full of life and joy.
This was the worst movie I have ever seen. Completely pointless.
"It was okayâ€”nothing special, but not terrible either."
"The cinematography was stunning, and the story was deeply emotional."
I felt really disappointed with the character development.
Great concept but poorly executed. I expected more.
Beautifully written and acted. It made me cry and smile.
